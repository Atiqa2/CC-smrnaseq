## Introduction

**nf-core/smrnaseq** is a bioinformatics best-practice analysis pipeline used for small RNA sequencing data.

The pipeline uses [Nextflow](https://www.nextflow.io), a bioinformatics workflow tool. It pre-processes raw data from FastQ inputs, aligns the reads and performs extensive quality-control on the results.

This pipeline is primarily used with a SLURM cluster on the Swedish [UPPMAX systems](https://www.uppmax.uu.se). However, the pipeline should be able to run on any system that Nextflow supports. We have done some limited testing using Docker and AWS, and the pipeline comes with some configuration for these systems. See the [installation docs](docs/installation.md) for more information.


## Documentation
The nf-core/smrnaseq pipeline comes with documentation about the pipeline, found in the `docs/` directory:
