## Introduction
**nf-core/smrnaseq** is a bioinformatics best-practice analysis pipeline used for small RNA sequencing data.

The pipeline is built using Nextflow, a workflow tool to run tasks across multiple compute infrastructures in a very portable manner. It comes with docker containers making installation trivial and results highly reproducible.

### Pipeline summary


1. Raw read QC ([`FastQC`](https://www.bioinformatics.babraham.ac.uk/projects/fastqc/))
2. Adapter trimming ([`Trim Galore!`](https://www.bioinformatics.babraham.ac.uk/projects/trim_galore/))
    1. Insert Size calculation
    2. Collapse reads ([`seqcsluter`](https://seqcluster.readthedocs.io/mirna_annotation.html#processing-of-reads))
3. Alignment against miRBase mature miRNA ([`Bowtie1`](http://bowtie-bio.sourceforge.net/index.shtml))
4. Alignment against miRBase hairpin
    1. Unaligned reads from step 3 ([`Bowtie1`](http://bowtie-bio.sourceforge.net/index.shtml))
    2. Collapsed reads from step 2.2 ([`Bowtie1`](http://bowtie-bio.sourceforge.net/index.shtml))
5. Post-alignment processing of miRBase hairpin
    1. Basic statistics from step 3 and step 4.1 ([`SAMtools`](https://sourceforge.net/projects/samtools/files/samtools/))
    2. Analysis on miRBase hairpin counts  ([`edgeR`](https://bioconductor.org/packages/release/bioc/html/edgeR.html))
         * TMM normalization and a table of top expression hairpin
         * MDS plot clustering samples
         * Heatmap of sample similarities
    3. miRNA and isomiR annotation from step 4.1 ([`mirtop`](https://github.com/miRTop/mirtop))
6. Alignment against host reference genome ([`Bowtie1`](http://bowtie-bio.sourceforge.net/index.shtml))
    1. Post-alignment processing of alignment against host reference genome ([`SAMtools`](https://sourceforge.net/projects/samtools/files/samtools/))
7. Novel miRNAs and known miRNAs discovery ([`MiRDeep2`] https://www.mdc-berlin.de/content/mirdeep2-documentation)
    1. Mapping against reference genome with the mapper module
    2. Known and novel miRNA discovery with the mirdeep2 module
8. miRNA quality control ([`mirtrace`](https://github.com/friedlanderlab/mirtrace))
9. Present QC for raw read, alignment, and expression results ([`MultiQC`](http://multiqc.info/))
